## Pitch
    I want to build a recipe web program that allows users to input, browse and favorite recipes. Users have access to a
    pantry which is a database containing all the ingredients they input as things they own. This pantry can be used to 
    filter recipes so only those which you can make with your current ingredients are displayed. Recipes can also be used to
    add ingredients to your shopping list, so if you want to make a recipe, you can easily see what you need to buy.

## Key Features
    Create/Login to an account
    Add Recipes
    Add ingredients to pantry
    Add ingredients to shopping list
    Favorite recipes

## Technologies
    HTML - Uses HTML to structure pages. Home page, recipe pages, pantry and shopping list pages.
    CSS - style that is simple with a specific consistent color scheme.
    JavaScript - provides login, accessing recipes, selecting ingredients and contributing to lists.
    React - Creates dynamic lists/recipe completions as well as composing ingredient/shopping lists.
    Web service - Shows favorite recipes of other users, number of recipes made.
    Authentication: Used in the login page where users can create an account and sign in.
    Database data: Stores users favorite recipes, completed recipes, shopping list, and    ingredients they have.
    WebSocket data: When a recipe is completed, it is shown on other users screens in real time.
